Pathfinder
==========

Pathfinder is a simple rougelike written in Lua using the Love2d framework. This project is a work in progress and likely will be forever. Expect bugs and random quirks.

The binary files are not currently distributed so building this will not work. This will change in the future.

Currently Implemented But Needs Work:
-------------------------------------
* a main menu
* using perlin noise to create a landscape
* using Cellular Automata to create a cave like map
* walking and collision detection
* monsters with A* path finding
* a very basic gui
* multiple leveled areas

Things That Haven't Been Started:
---------------------------------
* dungeon generation
* maze generation
* forest generation
* fog of war
* player map
* locations to overworld
* combat
* inventory
* items
* character creation
* Armor
* Magic
* more advanced monster AI (Flee, Intercept)
* add text to menu options
* pause menu
* NPCs
* towns
