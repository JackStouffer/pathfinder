Pathfinder
==========

Pathfinder is a simple rougelike written in Lua using the Love2d framework. This project is a work in progress and likely will be forever. Expect bugs and random quirks.

The binary files are not currently distributed so building this will not work. This will change in the future.

Currently Implemented But Needs Work:
-------------------------------------
* a main menu
* using perlin noise to create a landscape
* using a random "growing" algorithm to create a cave
* walking and collision detection
* monsters with A* path finding
* a very basic gui
* multiple leveled areas
* Fog of War
* locations to overworld
* dungeon generation

Things That Haven't Been Started:
---------------------------------
* maze generation
* forest generation
* player map
* combat
* inventory
* items
* character creation
* Armor
* Magic
* more advanced monster AI (Flee, Intercept)
* pause menu
* NPCs
* towns
