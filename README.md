Pathfinder
==========

Pathfinder is a simple rougelike written in Lua using the Love2d framework. This project is a work in progress and likely will be forever. Expect bugs and random quirks.

The actual release is in the stable branch which includes all of the binary files. If you are feeling adventurous you can download the binary files and add them to this code, but the stability is not likely.
