* Use tileset rendering instead of individual images
* Restructure game_state so that I don't have to keep creating if-else's for every different location I want to have
* Change collision detection and lighting so that there can be objects that are not walkable but light goes through them
* Add support for different sized dungeon levels
* Fix bug where killed monsters do not reset their tile to the walkable state
